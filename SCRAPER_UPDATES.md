### 3. Advanced Company Name Extraction

- **Connection Monitoring**: Monitors driver responsiveness and restarts if needed
- **Progressive Delays**: Longer delays every 20 requests to avoid being blocked
- **Error Page Detection**: Detects error pages and handles them appropriately

### 6. Improved Logging and Debugging
